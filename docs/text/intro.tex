The aim of~this work is to~explore solutions for~tracking bees for~the~purposes of~counting the~number of~bees arriving to~and leaving a~hive through a~monitored environment. The~final solution should be applicable on~an~embedded device allowing real-time processing at~a~5 Hz sampling frequency.

In~this work we discuss the~usage of~motion segmentation and other motion tracking techniques for our~task. Our proposed solution stands on~motion signal analysis and is discussed in~the second chapter of~this document.
