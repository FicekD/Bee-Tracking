In~this work we tackle a~problem of~counting bees leaving and arriving to~a~hive. After~a~brief summary of~motion tracking techniques in~the~first chapter we decided not to~use any of~them as~they are not very suited for our needs, we describe our~solution in~the~second chapter. The solution lies in~analyzing overall movement in~multiple sections of~region of~interest to~detect general movement and determine its direction. The algorithm's limitations are discussed at~the~end of~the~second chapter, and it can be run on~an~embedded device as~a~part of~online processing pipeline.
